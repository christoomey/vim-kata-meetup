## Vim Kata Meetup

This repo is the supporting content for a Boston Vim meetup held on November 12th, 2012.

The process is pretty simple. Each folder is a single exercise and contains two
files; the _berfore_ file and _after_ file.  The suggested approach is:

1. Open Vim with an even vertical split _before_ file on left, _after_ file on right. 
2. Hack on the _berfore_ file until it matches the _after_ file.
3. Try again using a different bit of vim functionality?
4. ...
5. Profit!

Each of the problems can be approached using a number of different Vim
features, and as in life there is rarely a single correct answer. Feel free to
experiment and try more than one technique to solve a problem. Have a solid handle
on search and replace? Try macros. Already mastered macros? Try the global command.

### Vimdiff

Vimdiff (`:diffthis` command in both buffers) can be a great help to understand
the problem.  The following maps can help with activating vimdiff mode. To
enable diff mode just use the `<leader>dt` map in both buffers. To disable, use
the `<leader>do` map in either buffer.

``` vim
nmap <leader>dt :diffthis<cr>
nmap <leader>do :diffoff<cr>
```

These maps have also been provided in a file named "diff_maps.vim" in the root
of this repo for easy sourcing. Simply `:source diff_maps.vim<cr>` and you're set.

### References & Support

Some sources that make for excellent deliberate Vim practice tools:

- [Vimgolf][] - Vim exercises with before and after text. Goal is to define the
  shortest sequence of Vim keystrokes that will change the before into the after.
- [RubyQuiz][] - An archive of a weekly coding challenging implimented in Ruby.
  Still great for practice
- [ProjectEuler][] - A math / logic focused programming challenge site. These
  ones get very tough very quick.

  that has a sequence of increasingly advanced Vim exercises.

  video of Gary Bernhardt performing a string calculator kata using TDD in Vim. Very impressive.
